Simple PRNG and complement to PRNG. So there's export limiation on the law, none for here.

There exists entropy decreasingly loop on them, might be precederes exists.

* En/Decryption -> SHA
  d'\_k := En/Dec(d_k,d_k+1), d^{n}\_k =: SHA
* SHA -> En/Decryption
  xor key for d_k: SHA(d_0, ..., d_k-1, d_k+1, ..., d_n,KEY)
* PRNG -> SHA
  internal state: PRNG(a_0), d0 := permutate bits : d ^ PRNG, d0'\_k := d0_k ^ d0_k+1, d0{n}\_k := SHA
* SHA -> PRNG
  r\_0 := SHA(time, uptime, entropy), r\_k+1 := SHA(r\_k, counter, deterministic entropy)
* En/Decryption -> PRNG
  r\_0 := En/Dec(time, uptime, entropy), r\_1 := entropy, r\_k+1 := En/Dec(r\_k, r\_k-1, counter, deterministic entropy)
* PRNG -> En/Decryption
  a(PRNG, k) * in + b(PRNG, k) in F_p(PRNG, k), for each blocks, shifts, minimum rand blocks and maximum rand another blocks en/dec.
* Simple PRNG
  (Originaly from my context, around 2004 sekitanbukuro -> around 2010's osayudo -> then, here, but, there might be preceders on other places.)  
  based on transcendal numbers generater taylor series, so with no complicated series, the structure
  for x = x_0 + x_1 * p' + x_2 * p'^2 + ... numbers, f(x):=a_0+a_1\*x+a_2\*x^2+..., 
  f(x):=&lt;\[1,x,x^2,...\],a&gt;, so with F_(p^k), x_l:=<a'\_l,\[1,x\]>, f(x)|\_F\_(p^k) = Sum_l a''\_l*\[1, x\_l\],
  for them, returns y_k s.t. y := y_0 + y_1 * p' + ... == f(x)|\_F\_(p^k).
  But for this, f(x) fundementally only shuffles entropy, so collecting entropy is the matter.
  N.B. with F_p'^2, it has a slight possibility to calculate whole f(x) with only their accuracy, but it's not,
  so F_(p'^p') accuracy is able to do them.  
  To harden this, please refer p2.
* Simple PKI (pre shared key):  
  PSend(Decrypted): PKI Pair(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random):  
    ALICE(Key2, Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random) <=> BOB(Key3, Key1', Random, PEnc(Decrypted, (Key1, Key1', Random))  
      ALICE <=> TORRENT(Key2, Key3) : Enc(Enc(Key1, SHA(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random)), Key2)  
      ALICE  => BOB(Key1', Random)  : PEnc(Decrypted, (Key1, Key1', Random))  
                                    : Enc(Decrypted, SHA(Enc(Key1, SHA(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random)), Key1', Random))  
      TORRENT(Key2, Key3) <=> BOB   : Enc(Enc(Key1, SHA(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random)), Key3)  
      BOB                           : PDec(PEnc(...), (Dec(Enc(Enc(...), Key3), Key3), Key1', Random))  
                                    : Dec(PEnc(...), SHA(Dec(Enc(Enc(Key1, SHA(...))), Key1', Random))  
  ALICE <=> BOB : By PSend(MSG) chain, make MSG, MSG, MSGOK, MSGOK, timenow, timenow.  
  But, there's no such protocols.
  
# General Tips
According to some google's xor description page, the bit operations can be described as a matrix-vector operation and bit count conditions on F_2^n.
(This is because b0 and b1 = b0 * b1, b0 xor b1 = b0 + b1 in F_2, not b0 = 1 xor b0, b0 or b1 = not (not b0 and not b1), operator + is described as addr that is implemented with a positive logic is only using them. So with them, any first order operations that results N operations can be described as a matrix operations on the bits in F_2^n, A in F_2^{n\*n}: y = Pi (A_k * x) this results y_result = Pi (A_result_k * x). (&lt;\[\[1, 1\], \[1, 0\]\]\[x, y\], \[\[1, 1\], \[1, 0\]\]\[x, y\]&gt; = ... = y and not x. so with x^2 = x, &lt;\[\[1, 1\],\[1, 0\]\] \[x, y\], \[1, 1\]&gt; should be the one, but not.)

So with good PRNG, random matrix sum Pi (B_k\*x) := y operation seems to harden the ones.

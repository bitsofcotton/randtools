Simple PRNG and complement to PRNG. So there's export limiation on the law, none for here.

There exists entropy decreasingly loop on them, might be precederes exists.

* En/Decryption -> SHA
  d'\_k := En/Dec(d_k,d_k+1), d^{n}\_k =: SHA
* SHA -> En/Decryption
  xor key for d_k: SHA(d_0, ..., d_k-1, d_k+1, ..., d_n,KEY)
* PRNG -> SHA
  internal state: PRNG(a_0), d0 := permutate bits : d ^ PRNG, d0'\_k := d0_k ^ d0_k+1, d0{n}\_k := SHA
* SHA -> PRNG
  r\_0 := SHA(time, uptime, entropy), r\_k+1 := SHA(r\_k, counter, deterministic entropy)
* En/Decryption -> PRNG
  r\_0 := En/Dec(time, uptime, entropy), r\_1 := entropy, r\_k+1 := En/Dec(r\_k, r\_k-1, counter, deterministic entropy)
* PRNG -> En/Decryption
  a(PRNG, k) * in + b(PRNG, k) in F_p(PRNG, k), for each blocks, shifts, minimum rand blocks and maximum rand another blocks en/dec.
* Simple PRNG
  (Originaly from my context, around 2004 sekitanbukuro -> around 2010's osayudo -> then, here, but, there might be preceders on other places.)  
  based on transcendal numbers generater taylor series, so with no complicated series, the structure
  for x = x_0 + x_1 * p' + x_2 * p'^2 + ... numbers, f(x):=a_0+a_1\*x+a_2\*x^2+..., 
  f(x):=&lt;\[1,x,x^2,...\],a&gt;, so with F_(p^k), x_l:=<a'\_l,\[1,x\]>, f(x)|\_F\_(p^k) = Sum_l a''\_l*\[1, x\_l\],
  for them, returns y_k s.t. y := y_0 + y_1 * p' + ... == f(x)|\_F\_(p^k).
  But for this, f(x) fundementally only shuffles entropy, so collecting entropy is the matter.
  N.B. with F_p'^2, it has a slight possibility to calculate whole f(x) with only their accuracy, but it's not,
  so F_(p'^p') accuracy is able to do them.  
  To harden this, please refer p2.
* Simple PKI (pre shared key):  
  PSend(Decrypted): PKI Pair(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random):  
    ALICE(Key2, Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random) <=> BOB(Key3, Key1', Random, PEnc(Decrypted, (Key1, Key1', Random))  
      ALICE <=> TORRENT(Key2, Key3) : Enc(Enc(Key1, SHA(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random)), Key2)  
      ALICE  => BOB(Key1', Random)  : PEnc(Decrypted, (Key1, Key1', Random))  
                                    : Enc(Decrypted, SHA(Enc(Key1, SHA(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random)), Key1', Random))  
      TORRENT(Key2, Key3) <=> BOB   : Enc(Enc(Key1, SHA(Key1, Decrypted, Key1', Random)), Key3)  
      BOB                           : PDec(PEnc(...), (Dec(Enc(Enc(...), Key3), Key3), Key1', Random))  
                                    : Dec(PEnc(...), SHA(Dec(Enc(Enc(Key1, SHA(...))), Key1', Random))  
  ALICE <=> BOB : By PSend(MSG) chain, make MSG, MSG, MSGOK, MSGOK, timenow, timenow.  
  But, there's no such protocols.
  
# General Tips
With 2^x:=\[1, x_0, ...,x_n, x_0 and x_1, ..., x_{n - 1} and x_n, ..., x_0 and ... and x_n\] form, the operation 'and' and 'not' is described as A in R^{N\*N}, A\*2^x, and recursive of another similar matrixes is also in them, so any functions that inputs n bits and output n bits, they can be described as R^{N\*N} matrix.  
So with good PRNG, such random matrix A and A \* 2^x seems to harden the original prng series. 

# General Tips 2
If we deal with if ... else ... methods, if we can have x_k := ifthenbit, we can handle them with
if ... block with A, else ... block with B, x_k\*A + (1-x_k)\*B matrix.

# General Tips Tips
2^x is defined by x and all combination on latter one are in the former one.
Because of this, the matrix describes any of the peano's axiom valid neuman computer program input to output relation.

# General Tips 3
If we deal them with psnd alternative unsafe algorithms, it believes outside of peano's axiom that to be A subset 2^N, B subset N, A/~ ~2 B/~3 on N, ~3 == id.
I don't know whether this is valid or not for calculating only with n bits on left and right on 2^x meanings.  
If we can't deal with them, please check conv_check alternatives.

# General Tips 4
Otherwise, suppose x in {0, 1}^{n0}, Xor\_k And\_m Xor\_n x\_{k,m,n}\*x\_n == any operation on them (And Xor ... is pattern match for 1 pattern, (a xor b) xor (a and b) == (a or b)). So with op == Sum\_k det diag (X\_k x) == det(diag(Y x)), this is done by counter diagonal method and LDLt with inverse matrix because X\_0 and X\_1 is max rank and 1 \< rank (det diag(X\_0^-1X\_1 x)+det diag(x) == det diag (LDL^t \[x, x\]) + det diag\[x, x\] == det diag LDx' + det diag L^{-t}x', so upper left or right down part factor makes them, then, unitary, recursive.), decompose 2 of them, then, all of them, and, this is able to be done because X\_k in Z^{n\*n} (not {0, 1}^{n\*n}). (a and b) is larger double by (a xor b), but whole of this, it's correct.  
So any op == det diag(Y x), x\_0:=1, x in {0, 1}^n, Y in Q^{n\*n}, in first digit meaning.
(Add 2022/12/26 first, g^n(op), then, operate with below, then, f^n causes +const. reduce the original glitch.)

# General Tips 5
After general tips 4, we can write d/dx\_l op == Pi\_l \<y'\_l, x\> with decreasing degree on them, so recursive on this, d/dx\_l ... op == \<y\*, x\>. And if we can define g(op) == f^{-1}(op) when x_n:=1, f(op)==d/dx_1 ... d/dx_{n-1} op == \<y\*,x\> (first digit) (this is done by general tips 4), and, g^n(op) = det(Y' x\*(x\_1\*...x\_n)), so to make f(g^n(f^{n-1}(op))), replace x\_k to x\_k^{n-1}, ok. if we use this conversion (x\_k to x\_k^m) into middle of the transform, it fails. And, x':=x\*x_1\*...\*x_n replace is needed per n degree.

This is also checked by partial integrals that: integrate det diag Y x dx_k == x_k det diag Y x - integrate x_k d/dx_k det diag Y x and d/dx_k them.

# General Tips 6
There exists taylor series tan((op_{first digit}-.5)&pi;/6) == (det diag B x) \* (x_1 ...)^some m / (det diag B' x) / (x_1 ...)^some m on some cut off.
(<strike>rank sin, cos(op) == 2 because we make const. delta,</strike>pass all of the first large dimension multipliers into sin, cos taylors, then, do below, we can get the result. tan theta itself cannot be used because they doesn't converges).
With below, we get op\_{near bit} == \<y\*\*,\[1,x\]\>/\<y'\*\*,\[1,x\]\>.

# General Tips 7
punched.

# General Tips 8
So with below, A in Q^{n\*n} : random matrix, x in {0, 1}^n, Ax in first digit meaning seems to harden the PRNG
if original PRNG is better enough (long period and no bias on distribution.).

# General Tips 9
If we work with F\_p p in P, this description is also valid because x in F\_p, #((ax+b)|\_x:fix)==#(F\_p to F\_p) .
so zero condition is valid. (with lagrange multipliers, all condition is valid with op_{first digit} with general tips 4, 5 method with n to p\*n.).
So p-adic computer is also described with lagrange multipliers and same methods, by op_{first digit}, this is in Z.
We can also take op == \<y_0,x\>/\<y_1,x\>, x in {p, 1, ..., p - 1}^n with some extra small error.

p-adic is also checked by toeplitz(x) \* a == f(x) linear permutation, because a\*x+b\+... describes them.

and op':=op(x_1,...,x_n)-x_n+1=some f(x_1,...,x_n+1), we have invariant, in this case, we can get g as \<y, tan(\[1,x,s\])\> == 0 condition, s is status bits. Status bit is needed because of rank condition, but, s can be rewrited as some A\*\[1,x\].

N.B. we should choose \<y, arctan(\[1,x\])\> with this form, but arctan has not have periods in itself. To make periods valid, we choose tan(a\*y):=tan(Ax) to adjust them, so using invariant, each of variables are rewrited to be A\<y,tan(\[1,x,B x\])\>.

If we work with x := {x\_k in \[0, &alpha;\[} that float styled, the description \<y,tan(\[1,x,A\*x\])\> form is valid also in this method. So with this, \[- &alpha;, &alpha;\[ can be.

# General Tips A
If we deal with large enough matrix tan(\[1,x+,B\*x+\]):=A\*tan(\[1,x,B\*x\]),
with smaller A', tan(\[1,x(small)+,B'\*x(small)+\])=
A'\*tan(\[1,x(small),B'\*x(small)\]).
So step some range and get invariant value is also valid operation if larger one function recursion exists.  
Some random methods compete with this s.t. permutation after making rand() series, but this results only larger original matrix.

N.B. this is the case PRNG initial stage smaller count than status variable dimensions.
So this isn't mean some distant result is written in smaller variable dimensions.

N.B. if we have a extreme enough accuracy, we can write down the condition x_n to x_n+x_{n-1}\*a^-k+..., so all of inner condition and
before state is represented by only one variable. So in this case, we can take the condition below A.row(A.rows() - 1), but in general,
the condition needs extremely high accuracy for vector a and input, it's not.

# General Tips B
If we have x_n := \<a,tan(\[1,x,B\*x\]\>, if we have {x_{kn}}, it's only recursive on A matrix, this causes p0 prediction valid.

# General Tips C
Some deep learning gets matrices on the result and after all, it's only a matrix. So with invariant meaning,
with A\[tan(x) tan(B\*x) tan(y) tan(C\*y)\]-&gt;0 matrix.
So if we can find an invariant on the data series with some expanded dimensions, we can define a mapping.

# General Tips D
punched.

# General Tips E
Only for invariant meaning, we can bet 0==arcsin(sin(\<a, x\>)) on the form, so it's also the form 0==\<a, x\>\*(x_1...x_n)^m (exists m for some error).
So linear invariant meaning from the data, it's also the form: \<d_k, x\>\/(x_1...x_n)^m is ok. So d_k into variable, it's \<d_k, x\>\/(d_1...d_n)^m.
if we ~ with only ratio on them, it's \<d_k, x\>\/(d_1...d_n)^(1/n).
